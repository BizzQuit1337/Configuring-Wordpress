As previously mentioned the staging website was acting slow and testing was difficult. To resolve this I have setup a local WordPress website on the blade server.
The current link to the site is: http://192.168.1.7/html/index.php/python/, I am creating a theme for the site that will hold all the library files we need. 
Once the theme works with the libraries I can add the current YOOtheme to the website to keep the design. 

Here are all the details for the WordPress site running off of the blade server so anyone can access them if neccecary.
 MySQL database:
- username:admin@localhost
- password:Passw0rd54321
- database name:wordpress

WordPress admin account:
- username:admin
- password:P@assw0rd54321
- email:albert@etcgroup.uk

FTP details:
-hostname:bladebox
-username:Admin
-password:password123
-port:21

This is not a live server and no information is sensetive or can be used for malicious purposes
